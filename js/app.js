// I. Variables & Datatypes
// A. Q + A
// How do we assign a value to a variable?
// How do we change the value of a variable?
// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
// What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how 
// you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code 
// to solve it?
// ANSWERS
// -by using = and then the value
// -assign it a new value within a scope
// -set them equal to each other
// -Declare is to establish a new variable
// -assign is to give an existing variable a value,
// -define is to give a variable a place
// -pseudocoding is writing out logical steps to use for coding problems
// -70-80%
// B. Strings
// Create a variable called firstVariable.
// Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
// Change the value of this variable to some number.
// Store the value of firstVariable in a new variable called secondVariable
// Change the value of secondVariable to any string.
// What is the value of firstVariable?
// Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string. 
// Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name 
// is " and the variable yourName so that 
// it returns a new string with them concatenated.
// ex: Hello, my name is Jean Valjean

let firstVariable = "Hello World";
firstVariable = 1;
let secondVariable = firstVariable;
secondVariable = "Hello !World";
console.log(firstVariable);
1
const yourName = "Donnie"
console.log("Hello, my name is " + yourName);
